# Class Diagram for the Hotel Management System
Learn to create a class diagram for the hotel management system problem using the bottom-up approach.

Here, we are going to create the class diagram for our system based on the requirements that we gathered in one of the previous lessons. 
In the class diagram, we will first design and create the classes, abstract classes, and interfaces for the system, and then we’ll identify the relationship between classes in accordance with all the requirements of the hotel management system.

## Components of a hotel management system
In this section, we’ll define the classes for a hotel management system. Since we are following the bottom-up approach to designing a class diagram, we will first create the classes of small components. 
Next, we will integrate these components and create the class diagram for the hotel management system.

### Address and Account
The Address class is required to store any address. 
It is a custom data type with attributes like a street address, city, etc. In the hotel management system, this class will be used to specify the addresses of the users and the hotel.

Account is a class used to store the user’s account information. 
This class has three members, i.e., account ID, password, and account status. The class representation of Address and Account classes is as follows:

### Person
Person is an abstract class used to store information related to a person, such as a name, email, phone number, etc. In this class, an object of the Address type specifies the person’s address. The Person class specifies the accounts in the system. The system has four types of accounts: housekeeper, receptionist, guest, and server.
There are multiple functions of the Person class’s subclasses. First, the Housekeeper class will keep track of the maintenance records of a room. Second, the Receptionist class represents the hotel receptionist. 
The methods in this class depict the actions that the receptionist can perform. Moreover, the Guest class describes the guests of the hotel. Guests are the hotel’s customers who can search for and book a room.
The relationship diagram for these classes is shown below:

### Service
Service is an abstract class that encapsulates the details of different types of services guests have requested. Three types of services are provided: amenity, room service, and kitchen service.

The Amenity class is a subclass of Service with two members: name and description. Similarly, RoomService is also inherited from the Service class. 
This class stores information about room services, whether these services are chargeable or not, and the request time of the service. Furthermore, the last child class of the Service is KitchenService. 
The relationship between these classes is shown in the illustration below.


### Invoice
The Invoice class represents the billing system in the hotel management system. 
The UML diagram for both classes is presented below:


### Room booking
The RoomBooking class is responsible for managing the bookings for a room. 
This class includes attributes like reservation number, start date, duration, etc. Moreover, this class has a member of the BookingStatus type that is used to store the status of the room booking. 
The UML representation of this class is as follows:


### Notification
Notification is an abstract class responsible for sending notifications to guests whenever the booking is nearing the check-in or check-out date. 
Every notification has an ID, creation date, and content. The notification can either be an SMS notification or an email notification.

The SMSNotification class requires the member’s phone number to send a notification. 
On the other hand, the EmailNotification needs the member’s email address to send a notification. 
The relationship diagram of these classes is shown here:

### Room, room key, and room maintenance
The Room class is the system’s basic building block. 
Every room has a room number and a price associated with it. 
The Room class uses the RoomStyle and RoomStatus enums to specify the rooms’ style and status, respectively.

Each room has an electronic key card associated with it. 
The RoomKey class expresses the electronic key card. Each card has its own unique ID and barcode. 
The RoomKey class also has members to store the issue date, to check whether or not the key is active, and to check whether or not a key is a master key. 
Whereas, RoomMaintenance is a class used to keep track of all maintenance records for the rooms. The UML representation of these classes is as follows:



### Search interface and catalog
Search is one of the most important components of the hotel management system. 
In the diagram below, Search is the interface that allows guests to search for any room of their choice and pay range. 
The receptionist can also use this interface to search for any room. The Catalog class contains a list of all rooms and implements the Search interface.

The following UML diagram shows this relationship:



### Bill transaction
After generating an invoice, a customer must pay the bill to confirm the room booking. 
A BillTransaction class is required to store the information of bill payment. 
Check, cash, and credit card transactions are three ways to pay the bill. We can define the bill payment functionality through any payment method using the diagram below:



### Hotel and hotel branch
In this section, we’ll look at the Hotel and HotelBranch classes. According to the requirements, there can be multiple branches of the hotel. 
HotelBranch is a class used to represent the location of the hotel branch. This class consists of two members: name and Address. 
The string type name is used to store the name of the hotel branch, while the complex object Address is used to store the complete address of a branch.
The Hotel class is the base class of the system, which is used to represent the hotel. 
The visual representation of these classes is as follows:


### Enumerations
Here is the list of enumerations required in the hotel management system:

* BookingStatus: This status describes the booking status, whether the booking is requested, pending, confirmed, canceled, or abandoned.
* PaymentStatus: This status describes the status of the booking’s payment, whether it is unpaid, pending, completed, failed, declined, canceled, abandoned, setting, settled, or refunded.
* RoomStatus: This status describes the room’s status, whether it is available, reserved, occupied, not available, being serviced, or any other possibility.
* RoomStyle: This describes the style of the room that the user wants to book. The style could be standard, deluxe, family, or business.
* AccountStatus: This status tells the status of the user account, whether it is active, closed, canceled, or blocklisted.
* AccountType: The account type tells the type of the user’s account, whether it is a member, guest, manager, or receptionist.




## Relationship between the classes
Now, we’ll discuss the relationships between the classes we have defined above in our hotel management system.

### Association
The class diagram has the following association relationships:

* One-way association
- The Housekeeper class has a one-way association with RoomMaintenance.
- Both Receptionist and Guest have a one-way association with RoomBooking.
- The RoomBooking class has a one-way association with Room.

* Two-way association
The RoomBooking class has a two-way association with Notification.

* Aggregation
The RoomBooking class is an aggregate of Service.

## Design pattern
We apply the object-oriented design patterns based on system behavior to implement hotel management systems’ core features in a flexible and scalable way.

The hotel system allows guests to receive notifications (like booking confirmations or reminders). The Observer design pattern can be used to model this behavior.

The hotel system supports payment methods such as credit card, cash, and check. To handle this flexibly, we can use the Strategy design pattern.

Booking confirmations may need to trigger different notifications (SMS or Email). We can use the Factory design pattern to manage these interchangeable notification types.

We know that each payment type (cash, credit, check) follows a similar flow, but with some specific steps. We can use the Template Method design pattern to structure this reusable logic.

We know that the catalog needs to manage and search through a collection of individual room objects. We can use the Composite design pattern to treat individual and grouped room operations uniformly.

We know that the catalog or hotel instance should be globally accessible and should not have multiple copies. To enforce a single instance, we can use the Singleton design pattern.

Room bookings and invoices involve setting multiple details, such as dates, rooms, guests, and status. The Builder design pattern can help us manage this complex construction clearly and safely.

We know that components like notification services or payment processors might change or need mocking in tests. To make the system more flexible and testable, we can use Dependency Injection.
